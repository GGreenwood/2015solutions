### Advent Of Code solutions

Got a solution? Put it in a pull request! I'll accept it so long as it's
possibly a solution.

Got a code critique? Same deal. Make your edits in a pull request and see what
happens.

Happy coding.

##### Naming convention
The 1 or 2 in the name depends on part 1 or part 2.
- p[1-2][a-z].[ext] - the code file. ext is c for C, cpp for C++, sh for POSIX sh...
	[a-z] are to differentiate between different solutions in the same 
	language.
- input[a-z]? - the input provided by the problem. Not all the inputs are the 
  same.
- p[1-2] - compiled binary. Not to be included in the repo, as per gitignore.
